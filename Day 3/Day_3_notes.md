# Booleans
- A boolean has two values: True or False. A boolean can be very useful while working with comparison operators, they return a boolean in it.

    # Truthy Values
    - All numbers(positive and negative) are truthy except zero.
    - All strings are truthy except an empty string(")
    - The Boolean true.

    # Falsy Values
    - 0
    - On
    - null
    - undefined
    - NaN
    - the boolean false
    - '',"",``, empty string.

Note - It is good to remember those truthy values and falsy values.

# Undefined
- If we declare a variable and if we do not assign a value, the value will be undefined. If function doesn't return a value, it will be undefined.

# Operators

## Assignment Operator -> '='

## Arithmetic Operators
    - Arithmetic Operators are mathematical operators
    (i) Addition (+) : a + b
    (ii)Subtraction (-) : a - b
    (iii)Multiplication (*) : a * b
    (iV) Division(/) : a/b
    (v)Modulus(%) : a % b
    (vi)Exponential(**): a ** b

## Comparison Operators
- ==, != , === , > , < , >= , <=

## Logical Operator
- &&(ampersand) : is True when two operands are true.
- || : This operator is true when either of the condition is true.
- ! : Operator negates to True to False and False to True.

## Increment Operator
1. Pre-increment : console.log(++___)
2. Post-increment : console.log(____++)

## Decrement Operator 
1. Pre-Decrement : console.log(--_____) 
2. Post-Decrement : console.log(____--)

## Ternary Operators
- Ternary Operator allows to write a condition. Another way to write conditionals is using ternary operators.

## Operator Precendence
- Read about operator precedence from : https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence

- Operator precedence determines how operators are parsed concerning each other. Operators with higher precedence become the operands of operators with lower precedence.

- Operator precendence control the precendence of the operators. There are two types of precendence Higher precendence and lower precendence.
